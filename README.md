# rustttp
simple rust-based web server with html, css and js serving capabilities, images can be imported in your own html code


make sure you at least have a file named "index.html" as this is the default location users are directed to once they load the root of your server. if you wish to include links to other files or embed scripts and images, you will need to implement that in your own html code
